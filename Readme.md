Copy the file, change the `en-US` part of the file name to the language code of your own country, such as `KingdomMod.OverlayMap.Language.ru-RU.cfg`, and then localize the strings in the file translate.
* Welcome to share your language and style files: [Share Entry](https://github.com/abevol/KingdomMod/issues/3).
